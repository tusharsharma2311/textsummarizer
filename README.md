In the context of this project, the goal is to develop an advanced text 
summarization system that leverages deep learning techniques to generate 
concise and coherent summaries from input text. 
1. We will be utilizing abstractive summarization technique. Abstractive 
summarization is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that 
involves generating a concise and coherent summary of a longer text while 
using original phrasing, often rephrasing, and paraphrasing the content.
2. In other words, abstractive summarization aims to produce human-like 
summaries that capture the main ideas and important details of the source 
text while also generating new sentences that might not appear in the original 
text.
